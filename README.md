# working-with-Json
A program that reports the counts of document categories (such as "Law_Crime" and "Social Issues") in the corpus as a dictionary and saves the results in yet another JSON file summary.json. The keys in the dictionary are document categories; the values are document counts. Use module JSON for data loading/storing and class Counter for counting.
